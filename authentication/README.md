# Authentication for Go Applications

Authentication is the first and most important step for system security. It helps identify your users, and once they're identified, you can check user authorization before providing access to system resources.

### Five different authentication methods:

- HTTP
- bearer token 
- JWT
- OIDC
- SAML
